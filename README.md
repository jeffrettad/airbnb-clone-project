## Overview of the AirBnB Clone
# üöÄ  Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# üèÜ  Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# ‚öôÔ∏è  Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
+ Backend Developer: back-end developer are not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect‚Äîfor example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations
+ Database Administrator & DevOps Engineer: They oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.
+ QA Engineer:
  
(i) They makes sure an application performs according to requirements

(ii) They Spots functional and non-functional defects

# Database Design
# User

- id, name, email, role

- A user can own multiple Properties

- A user can make multiple Bookings

- A user can leave multiple Reviews

- A user can make multiple Payments

# Property

- id, title, description, location, price_per_night

- Belongs to a User (host)

- Has many Bookings

- Has many Reviews

# Booking

- id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status

- Belongs to a User (guest)

- Belongs to a Property

- Has many Payments

# Review

- id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment

- Belongs to a User

- Belongs to a Property

# Payment

- id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, status

  - Belongs to a Booking
 
  ## üîê API Security

Ensuring the security of backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive user data, maintain trust, and safeguard financial transactions. The following security measures will be implemented in the Airbnb Clone project:

### 1. Authentication
Only verified users will be allowed to access the system using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.  
**Why:** Protects against unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can interact with the platform.  

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to determine what actions users can perform (e.g., hosts can create properties, guests can make bookings).  
**Why:** Prevents users from accessing data or features they are not permitted to use, ensuring data integrity and privacy.  

### 3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) will be encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/SSL) and at rest.  
**Why:** Protects against data breaches and ensures that intercepted data cannot be read by attackers.  

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
API endpoints will include rate limiting to prevent abuse such as brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.  
**Why:** Maintains system availability and prevents malicious users from overwhelming the platform.  

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized before processing to guard against injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).  
**Why:** Prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities to manipulate the system or access restricted data.  

### 6. Secure Payment Handling
Payment data will be processed through trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with PCI-DSS compliance.  
**Why:** Ensures financial transactions are handled securely, protecting both users

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.  
They help ensure that new changes are integrated smoothly into the project, reducing manual errors and speeding up development cycles.  

### Why It‚Äôs Important
- **Consistency:** Ensures all code changes are tested and deployed in the same way every time.  
- **Faster Delivery:** Automates repetitive tasks, allowing new features and fixes to reach production quicker.  
- **Improved Quality:** Automated tests run on each commit, helping detect bugs early in the development process.  
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute without breaking the main branch.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment workflows directly within GitHub.  
- **Docker:** Provides containerized environments to ensure consistent builds across development, staging, and production.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI):** Can also be integrated to manage more complex workflows if needed.
